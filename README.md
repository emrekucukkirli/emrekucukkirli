I am Emre. I have been developing websites and WordPress themes. I enjoy working on the front-end. I
have worked on many projects solo and as a team member. In the projects I am part of: I love contributing to the
project in different disciplines (design, idea, lang) and being a part of the project development process. I work
with focus and passionately. I try to discover areas that I can offer better while reviewing the code I've written.
